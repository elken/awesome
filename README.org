#+title: Awesome

[[file:.github/assets/arch.png]]
My humble etc etc you know the drill here. Super hacky/WIP, don't expect this to work well for you.

* Install
#+begin_src shell
cp -R ~/.config/awesome ~/.config/awesome.bak
git clone --recursive https://github.com/elken/awesome ~/.config/awesome/
#+end_src

Currently relies on:
- awesome 4.3 (awesome-git is "WIP", there's some neat stuff there but it full-on breaks some of my custom widgets and I'm lazy)
- picom: ideally jonaburg's fork but any should work
- [[https://github.com/elken/.files][my dotfiles]]: should be self-explanatory really
- [[https://blingcorp.github.io/bling/#/README][bling]] (setup via submodule, be sure to clone accordingly)
- Anything listed in [[file:globals.lua][globals.lua]]
